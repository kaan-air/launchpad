# launchpad
A collection of fun/interesting node programs specifically designed to run on the Novation Launchpad X. To run any app, simply use the command `node apps/<app_name.js>` (for example `node apps/connect4.js`)

### colors.js
Showcases all 128 possible color values that the Novation Lanuchpad X can represent (0-127). Use the UP/DOWN arrow buttons to cycle between page 1 (colors 0-63) and page 2 (colors 64-127)

### rain.js
The first program that I wrote for the Launchpad X. Simply tap one of the pads in any column then watch a raindrop gently fall to the bottom.

### sandbox.js
An app I use to test ideas before turning them into dedicated files/apps within the repo. Potentially unstable

# WIP:

### smarthome/index.js
Using sliders in `sliders.js` to control smart home accessories, and PC RGB lights through OpenRGB
